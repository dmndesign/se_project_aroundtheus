# Project 3: Around The U.S.

**Project Description**

Current project is "user profile with gallery". You can see in it "profile image", "profile name", "edit button", "add button" "profile description" and "card gallery".

**Functionality and Technologies**

For this project we used HTMl, BEM and CSS.
Also we used Media Queries to make our project responsive.
CSS grid was very helpful to build up gallery in project.

**Future Updates**

In future we will add some "magic" to our project which called JavaScript. So "add button" will add images, "edit button" will let us edit "profile name" and click on "profile image" let us edit it aswell.
